![The Evolution of Citrix Workspace Environment Management Service]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/the-evolution-of-citrix-wem-service/evolution-wem.jpg)

Citrix WEM Service environment is consistently updating and bringing enhanced capability to the table. This post aims to track the changes and releases as they occur, and provide a single point of reference

I will do my best to maintain this list as and when features come out, as well as some commentary around their value where I can.

**Feature:** [Support for migrating your service instance yourself](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/workspace-environment-management/service.html)

Connect your Citrix Cloud account to your Azure AD -> Add the applicable group to Citrix Cloud from Azure AD -> Users can sign in to Citrix Cloud by using their Azure AD credentials

## - - - - - November 2021

**Feature:** [Allow users to self-elevate certain applications](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/workspace-environment-management/service/using-environment-management/security.html#self-elevation)

**Detail:** This release introduces `self-elevation` for the `privilege elevation` feature. With s`elf-elevation`, you can automate privilege elevation for certain users without the need to provide the exact executables beforehand. Those users can request self-elevation for any applicable file simply by right-clicking the file and then selecting `Run with administrator privileges` in the context menu. After that, a prompt appears, requesting that they provide a reason for the elevation. This reason is for captured for auditing purposes. If the criteria is met, the elevation is applied, and the files run successfully with administrator privileges.

In addition, self-elevation provides flexibility to create allow lists for the files you permit users to self-elevate or block lists for files you want to prevent users from self-elevating.

Minimum agent version required: 2109.2.0.1

**Detail:** You can now use the CVAD Service console to bind a catalog to a WEM configuration set. This is a quick option to automatically add a catalog to WEM configuration sets
