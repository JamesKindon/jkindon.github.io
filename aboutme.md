A solutions Architect by day focused on the design and implementation of Microsoft, Citrix and VMware virtualisation technologies, specifically in relation to EUC and Mobility.

Currently I work for the awesome crew at [Insentra](https://www.insentragroup.com/au/) and enjoy life on the South Coast of NSW

I am lucky enough to be a part of the Citrix CTP community and a Microsoft MVP in Enterprise Mobility

Community is **King**, you can find an awesome community home at [The world of EUC slack channel](https://worldofeuc.github.io/Website/)
